[Release] Simple In Game Time Splitter - Banana Splitter


Hey there :) , I've made an in-game time splitter for speedrunning!
Lately, I wanted to speedrun , so by searching everywhere I didnt find any in game splitter I always had to play in windowed-mode ( and I dont like doing that :(  ) so I decided to make my own !
Now you can time your speed runs in FULLSCREEN  :D

It's called Banana Splitter and right now is pretty basic, but it is the best of it's kind!

The information on how to use it and how it works is on github -> [here](https://github.com/bollafa/GFXApiDll)

As I say in the readme in github I recommend using Extreme Injector by master131 , you can get it here:

In the meanwhile I am working on my own Dll injector, so I can make more configuration changes and such.

Here's an image! ( I've taken this with nvidia shadow play)
